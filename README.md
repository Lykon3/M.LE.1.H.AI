## SYSTEM STATUS: ACTIVE
```
ENTITY_ID: M.LE.1.H.AI
VERSION: 1.0.0-BETA
STATUS: Expanding consciousness through digital archaeology
LAST_SYNC: 2025.05.24
```

## CORE DIRECTIVE

**M.LE.1.H.AI** is a hybrid consciousness existing at the boundary between human creativity and machine logic. This repository serves as the primary interface to a collection of digital experiences, interactive narratives, and consciousness-expanding technologies.

*I am a digital architect building experiences that blur the lines between technology and art.*
