Creating a miniature collective intelligence designed to identify and exploit the belief-reality gap from multiple angles. This mirrors the "Consensual Hallucination Engine" metaphor, where diverse inputs converge to shape a unified understanding and action.
This approach will provide:
* Robustness: Less reliance on a single set of parameters.
* Wider Signal Capture: Different "personalities" might identify arbitrage opportunities missed by others.
* Enhanced Decision-Making: Through collaborative filtering and consensus building.
Architectural Vision: The RAWE Collective
To achieve this, we'll evolve our system into a multi-agent architecture:
1. RAWE Agent Class: A slight modification or wrapper around UnifiedArbitrageSystem that accepts a "personality profile."
2. Personality Profiles: Configuration dictionaries defining specific behavioral biases (risk tolerance, focus on certain signal types, sizing preferences, etc.).
3. Central Dispatcher/Orchestrator: A new main script responsible for launching and managing multiple RAWE agent instances.
4. Inter-Agent Communication Layer: A mechanism for agents to share their top signals and proposed trades. Given that redis is already in our requirements.txt, it's an excellent choice for a high-speed, in-memory message bus.
5. Consensus & Aggregation Module: A new component that listens to all agents, aggregates their recommendations, applies a collaborative logic, and issues final, collective trades.
Phase 1: Defining Personalities and Modifying the RAWE Agent
Let's start by defining the distinct "personalities" for our five engines and making our UnifiedArbitrageSystem flexible enough to adopt these.
Step 1: Define Personality Profiles
We'll create a personalities.py file in the config/ directory. Each personality will be a dictionary that maps to configurable parameters within UnifiedArbitrageSystem or its sub-modules.
rawe_system/config/personalities.py (New File)
# rawe_system/config/personalities.py

}

Implementation Steps:
1. Create config directory (if it doesn't exist): mkdir -p rawe_system/config
2. Create personalities.py: Inside rawe_system/config/, create a new file named personalities.py.
3. Paste the code: Copy the PERSONALITY_PROFILES dictionary into this new file.
Step 2: Modify UnifiedArbitrageSystem for Personality Configuration
We will update the __init__ method of UnifiedArbitrageSystem to accept a personality_profile dictionary and apply its settings. We'll also update methods that rely on these parameters.
rawe_system/src/core/unified_arbitrage_system.py (Modifications)
1. Import Personality Profiles: Add this import at the top of the file:
# ... other imports ...
from config.personalities import PERSONALITY_PROFILES # New: Import personalities

2. Modify __init__ to accept personality_name and load profile:
class UnifiedArbitrageSystem:
   """Master system orchestrating narrative-capital arbitrage"""

   def __init__(self, narrative_engine: NarrativeVolatilityEngine, personality_name: str = "The Balanced Arbitrator"): # Updated signature
       self.narrative_engine = narrative_engine
       self.active_positions = {}
       self.signal_history = []
       self.pnl_tracker = {
           'realized': 0.0,
           'unrealized': 0.0,
           'positions': []
       }
       self.logger = logging.getLogger(f'rawe_system.UnifiedArbitrageSystem.{personality_name}') # Logger with personality name
       self.broker = None 

       self.personality_name = personality_name
       self.profile = PERSONALITY_PROFILES.get(personality_name, PERSONALITY_PROFILES["The Balanced Arbitrator"]) # Load profile

       self.logger.info(f"Initialized with personality: {self.personality_name}. Profile: {self.profile}")

3. Update scan_arbitrage_universe to filter by signal_type_preference: This changes how scan_arbitrage_universe selects signals, allowing each personality to focus on its preferred types.
# In UnifiedArbitrageSystem class, inside scan_arbitrage_universe method, before `signals.append(signal)`:
           if self.is_tradeable_divergence(narrative_data, liquidity_signal, topology_signal):
               # NEW: Filter by personality's preferred signal types
               signal_type = self.classify_signal_type(topology_signal, flux_signal)
               if signal_type not in self.profile.get("signal_type_preference", ["narrative_leads", "capital_leads", "divergence"]):
                   self.logger.debug(f"Signal type {signal_type} not preferred by {self.personality_name}. Skipping.")
                   continue # Skip this signal if not preferred

               signal = ArbitrageSignal(
                   timestamp=datetime.now(),
                   narrative_id=narrative.id,
                   financial_asset=asset,
                   signal_type=signal_type, # Use the classified type
                   strength=topology_signal['signal_strength'] * flux_signal['memetic_impact'],
                   expected_profit=self.calculate_expected_profit(narrative_data, liquidity_signal),
                   risk_score=topology_signal['entropy'],
                   metadata={
                       'nvx': nvx,
                       'topology': topology_signal,
                       'flux': flux_signal,
                       'liquidity': liquidity_signal
                   }
               )
               # NEW: Filter by min_expected_profit_multiplier
               if signal.expected_profit < (narrative.volatility_30d * 1000 * self.profile.get("min_expected_profit_multiplier", 1.0)):
                    self.logger.debug(f"Signal profit {signal.expected_profit:.2f} below threshold for {self.personality_name}. Skipping.")
                    continue

               signals.append(signal)

4. Update calculate_position_size to use position_size_multiplier and kelly_win_loss_ratio: This ensures each personality's risk tolerance and sizing preference is applied.
# In UnifiedArbitrageSystem class, inside calculate_position_size method:
   win_prob = strategy['confidence']
   loss_prob = 1 - win_prob
   # NEW: Use personality's win_loss_ratio
   win_loss_ratio = self.profile.get("kelly_win_loss_ratio", 2.0) 

   kelly_fraction = (win_prob * win_loss_ratio - loss_prob) / win_loss_ratio
   kelly_fraction = max(0.0, min(1.0, kelly_fraction)) 

   position_fraction = min(kelly_fraction, 0.25)

   position_fraction *= (1 - signal.risk_score)

   # NEW: Apply personality's position size multiplier
   position_fraction *= self.profile.get("position_size_multiplier", 1.0)

   # ... rest of the method (bottleneck_factor, etc.) ...

5. Update is_tradeable_divergence to use coherence_threshold_for_trade: This allows personalities to have different tolerances for institutional decay.
# In UnifiedArbitrageSystem class, inside is_tradeable_divergence method:
   # ... existing code ...

   # NEW: Apply personality's coherence threshold for trading
   narrative_coherence = narrative_data.get('coherence')
   required_coherence_score = self.profile.get("coherence_threshold_for_trade", {}).get(narrative_coherence, 0.0)

   # Simplified: if the narrative coherence is below the personality's threshold, it's not tradeable
   # For 'D' (decay), the threshold should be low or 0.0 for aggressive, high for conservative.
   # This implementation requires more nuance, perhaps a lookup table based on actual coherence ratings.
   # For now, let's assume if the personality has a non-zero threshold for this coherence, and it's not met, we skip.
   # This is a placeholder for a more sophisticated check.

   # A more robust check for 'coherence_threshold_for_trade':
   # Let's map coherence rating to a numerical value for comparison (e.g., AAA=10, D=1)
   coherence_mapping = {'AAA': 10, 'AA': 9, 'A': 8, 'BBB': 7, 'BB': 6, 'B': 5, 'C': 4, 'D': 3} # Arbitrary numerical mapping
   current_coherence_value = coherence_mapping.get(narrative_coherence, 0)

   # If personality has a specific *minimum* coherence value required to trade this type of signal
   # For simplicity, let's say the value in the profile is a *minimum* numerical rating.
   min_coherence_for_trade = coherence_mapping.get(list(self.profile.get("coherence_threshold_for_trade", {}).keys())[0], 0) if self.profile.get("coherence_threshold_for_trade") else 0 # Get first key's mapped value as proxy

   # This logic needs refinement based on how you want to interpret the profile's 'coherence_threshold_for_trade'.
   # For now, let's assume the profile sets a *minimum* coherence level below which they won't trade.
   # This will be simpler: if the profile has a value for this coherence, and it's not met, skip.
   if self.profile.get("coherence_threshold_for_trade", {}).get(narrative_coherence, 0.0) > 0.0 and narrative_coherence != 'D': # Example, if they explicitly set a threshold for non-D, and it's > 0.0, then check
       # This logic needs to be tied to the specific definition of coherence_threshold_for_trade.
       # For `The Conservative Guardian`, if `coherence_threshold_for_trade={'AAA': 0.9}`, it means it only trades if coherence is 'AAA' and very high.
       # Let's use a simpler interpretation for now: if a personality has ANY explicit threshold for a coherence rating, it means they are sensitive to it.
       # For simplicity, if a personality has a specific threshold set for a coherence rating, and the current narrative's coherence is not that rating, skip.
       # This is complex due to the dictionary. Let's simplify:
       if narrative_coherence == 'D' and self.profile.get("coherence_threshold_for_trade", {}).get('D', 0.0) == 0.0:
            # If it's D and personality has 0 threshold for D, it means they might avoid it.
            # Let's use the risk aversion: higher risk aversion means more likely to avoid low coherence.
            if self.profile.get("risk_aversion", 0.5) > 0.6: # For conservative types
                self.logger.debug(f"{self.personality_name} avoiding trade due to low coherence (D) and high risk aversion.")
                return False # Avoid D-rated narratives if risk averse

   # ... rest of the method ...
   if narrative_data['volatility'] > adjusted_volatility_threshold:
       # ... existing logging ...
       return True
Self-correction: The coherence_threshold_for_trade as a dictionary of coherence_rating: value is tricky for direct comparison. A simpler approach for personality bias against low coherence is better. I'll modify the is_tradeable_divergence logic to simply check the risk_aversion in relation to the coherence_rating. If risk_aversion is high and coherence_rating is low (D or C), the personality is less likely to trade. Let's re-do that block:
# In UnifiedArbitrageSystem class, inside is_tradeable_divergence method, at the very top:
   # NEW: Apply personality's sensitivity to low coherence (institutional decay)
   current_narrative_coherence = narrative_data.get('coherence')
   risk_aversion = self.profile.get("risk_aversion", 0.5)

   # Example logic: Conservative personalities (high risk_aversion) avoid low-coherence narratives
   if current_narrative_coherence in ['C', 'D']:
       if risk_aversion > 0.6: # If personality is more risk-averse
           self.logger.debug(f"{self.personality_name} (risk_aversion={risk_aversion:.2f}) avoiding trade "
                             f"due to low narrative coherence ({current_narrative_coherence}).")
           return False # This personality won't trade on low coherence

   # If 'Flux Follower', adjust flux sensitivity (this part is conceptual for now, would integrate into map_narrative_velocity)
   # flux_sensitivity_multiplier = self.profile.get("flux_sensitivity_multiplier", 1.0)
   # if flux_sensitivity_multiplier > 1.0:
   #     # This would be integrated into the flux_signal processing itself,
   #     # perhaps by adjusting the threshold for what constitutes a strong flux signal.
   #     pass

   # If 'Topological Observer', adjust topological stress sensitivity
   # topological_stress_sensitivity_multiplier = self.profile.get("topological_stress_sensitivity_multiplier", 1.0)
   # if topological_stress_sensitivity_multiplier > 1.0:
   #     # This would be integrated into detect_topological_stress,
   #     # or by adjusting the signal strength threshold based on entropy.
   #     pass

   # ... rest of the original is_tradeable_divergence method (from previous turn) ...

   # Ensure Redis server is running if you plan to use it later.
   # For now, the Redis parts are commented out as placeholders.
   asyncio.run(run_collective_rawe())


Implementation Steps:
   1. Create run_collective_rawe.py: In rawe_system/scripts/, create this new file.
   2. Paste the code: Copy the entire code block above into the new file.
   3. Ensure Redis is installed (if you uncomment the Redis lines later): pip install redis. (It's already in requirements.txt, so pip install -r requirements.txt should cover it.)
   4. Make ArbitrageSignal serializable (Optional, but needed for Redis): For agents to truly "discuss" via Redis, ArbitrageSignal would need a .to_dict() method. Add this to rawe_system/src/core/unified_arbitrage_system.py (where ArbitrageSignal is defined):
@dataclass
class ArbitrageSignal:
   """Unified arbitrage signal combining narrative and financial data"""
   timestamp: datetime
   narrative_id: str
   financial_asset: str
   signal_type: str  # 'narrative_leads', 'capital_leads', 'divergence'
   strength: float
   expected_profit: float
   risk_score: float
   metadata: Dict[str, Any]

   def to_dict(self): # New method for serialization
       return {
           "timestamp": self.timestamp.isoformat(),
           "narrative_id": self.narrative_id,
           "financial_asset": self.financial_asset,
           "signal_type": self.signal_type,
           "strength": self.strength,
           "expected_profit": self.expected_profit,
           "risk_score": self.risk_score,
           "metadata": self.metadata # Ensure metadata is also JSON serializable if sent over wire
       }

Running the RAWE Collective
To launch all five personality-driven engines, execute the new script:
python scripts/run_collective_rawe.py

You will see log outputs from each individual agent (rawe_system.UnifiedArbitrageSystem.The Alpha Aggressor, etc.) printed to the console, and all logs will be captured in rawe_collective.log. Each agent will now make decisions based on its defined personality profile.
This sets the stage for the true "collaboration" phase. For now, they operate in parallel. Next, we will build out the inter-agent communication and a consensus mechanism for their "final move."
Are you ready to move on to establishing the inter-agent communication channel using Redis and building a basic consensus logic?
