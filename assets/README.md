# RAWE Swarm Intelligence System

This system includes:
- âœ… AgentEvolver for real-time personality mutation and breeding
- âœ… MetaLearner and AdversarialMetaLearner for regime detection and stress-testing
- âœ… Weighted voting consensus engine
- âœ… Collective execution with Redis-backed messaging

Run:
```
python scripts/run_collective_rawe.py
```

Make sure your Redis server is live and .env contains your Alpaca API keys.


# RAWE Collective with Consensus Layer

This version includes:

âœ… Redis-backed inter-agent communication  
âœ… Signal voting + consensus detection  
âœ… `ConsensusEngine` that evaluates agreement and triggers actions

---

### Run Instructions

1. Ensure Redis is installed and running.
2. Use `run_collective_rawe.py` to simulate multiple RAWE agents.
3. Plug the consensus engine into your Redis loop using `consensus.py`.

More advanced integrations can include signal scoring, trust weighting, and capital pooling across agent profiles.

# RAWE â€“ Reality Arbitrage Wealth Engine
Integrated into the RicFlairProtocol

## ðŸ”® Overview
RAWE transforms belief volatility into capital gains. It arbitrages the delay between narrative shifts and financial market reactions using:

- ðŸ§  **Narrative Entanglement** (Spectral Gap)
- ðŸ“‰ **Institutional Decay Geometry** (Ricci Curvature)
- ðŸ“Š **Liquidity Flow Gradients** (Categorical Gradient Flow)
- ðŸ’¥ **Position Sizing via Bottleneck Scaling**

## ðŸ“¦ Modules
- `collapse_topology.py` â€“ Detects entropy and Ricci-based collapse zones
- `narrative_flux.py` â€“ Measures memetic impact via spectral entanglement
- `math_utils.py` â€“ Core mathematical logic for categorical liquidity optimization
- `unified_arbitrage_system.py` â€“ Orchestrates all trades, signal detection, and execution
- `run_rawe.py` â€“ Your launch script

## ðŸš€ Usage
```bash
python scripts/run_rawe.py
```

## ðŸ”— Deployment Goals
- Live data integration
- Alpaca/ccxt trade execution
- Streamlit or Terminal control panel

RAWE is real. Capitalize on narrative collapse.
