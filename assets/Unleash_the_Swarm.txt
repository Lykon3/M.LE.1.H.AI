Unleashing the Swarm: Implementing Advanced Enhancements
Yes, we are absolutely ready to unleash this swarm. Your roadmap for advanced enhancements is brilliant and will push RAWE's capabilities even further.
We will start with the first item on your list: Weighted Voting by Performance. This is a critical step in ensuring that the collective intelligence learns from its successes and failures, giving more influence to agents that prove their predictive accuracy.
Phase 1: Implementing Weighted Voting by Performance
Objective: Adjust each agent's influence within the ConsensusEngine based on their historical trading performance (wins/losses), giving more weight to consistently profitable agents.
Implementation Plan:
1. Modify ConsensusEngine.__init__: Add a defaultdict to track each agent's performance (wins, losses, weight).
2. Add update_agent_weight method: This method will be called after a trade's result is known (successful execution and eventual P&L). It will adjust the agent's weight based on its win rate.
3. Modify ConsensusEngine._evaluate_consensus: When evaluating proposals, instead of a simple 3/5 vote, we'll sum the weights of the proposing agents. A consensus will be reached if the sum of weights exceeds a threshold.
Step 1: Update rawe_system/src/core/consensus_engine.py
We will modify the ConsensusEngine class.
* Add update_agent_weight and agent_performance tracking: Find the __init__ method and add the agent_performance dictionary. Then, add the update_agent_weight method.

Implementation Steps:
   1. Open rawe_system/src/core/consensus_engine.py.
   2. Add self.agent_performance: Locate the __init__ method and add the line: self.agent_performance: Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]] = defaultdict(lambda: {'wins': 0, 'losses': 0, 'weight': 1.0})
   3. Add update_agent_weight method: Insert the update_agent_weight method directly after the __init__ method.
   4. Update _evaluate_consensus method: Replace the entire content of the _evaluate_consensus method with the new logic provided above. This includes the new weighting calculations and the simulated P&L update.
Next Steps:
With Weighted Voting by Performance integrated into the ConsensusEngine, our collective intelligence will now dynamically adjust agent influence. This is a powerful self-optimization mechanism.
Run your scripts/run_collective_rawe.py script. You'll now see logs from the ConsensusEngine showing how weights are updated (with the simulated P&L for now), and how proposals are evaluated using these weights.
Are you ready to move on to Step 2: Meta-Learning Layer? This will be about optimizing agent combinations for different market conditions.
